## UI Elements

- Avoid overly bright greens (#00ff00, #4ade80, etc.)

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Style
- Clear, concise, and direct
- Professional but not cold
- Technical but approachable
- Focus on collective intelligence and resilience
- Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and trendy phrases

### Terminology
- Use "Community" instead of "Users"
- Use "Collective" instead of "Group"
- Use "Memories" instead of "Posts" or "Content"
- Use "Authentication" instead of "Login"
- Use "Nodes" instead of "Devices"
