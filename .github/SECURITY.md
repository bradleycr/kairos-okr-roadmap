## 🔐 **Security Considerations**

### **Cryptographic Security**

KairOS uses industry-standard cryptographic libraries and practices:

- **Ed25519** signatures via `@noble/ed25519`
- **Private keys** never leave user devices
- **Zero-database** architecture prevents data breaches
- **Challenge-response** authentication prevents replay attacks

### **NFC Security**

- Only **public data** stored on NFC chips
- **Device-specific** key derivation
- **Signature verification** for all operations
- **No sensitive data** transmitted over NFC

### **Web Security**

- **HTTPS-only** communication
- **Content Security Policy** (CSP) headers
- **Secure cookie** settings
- **XSS protection** via proper input sanitization

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### **For Users**

- **Never share** your private keys
- **Verify signatures** before trusting data
- **Use secure networks** when possible
- **Keep software updated**

### **For Developers**

- **Follow secure coding** practices
- **Validate all inputs** thoroughly
- **Use parameterized queries** (when applicable)
- **Implement proper authentication**
- **Regular security audits**

## 🧪 **Security Testing**

We encourage security researchers to:

- **Test cryptographic implementations**
- **Audit authentication flows**
- **Check for timing attacks**
- **Verify signature implementations**
- **Test NFC security protocols**

## 🏆 **Responsible Disclosure**

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- **Acknowledge** your contribution
- **Work with you** to understand and resolve the issue
- **Credit you** in our security advisories (unless you prefer otherwise)
- **Keep you informed** throughout the resolution process

## 📋 **Security Updates**

Security updates will be:

- **Clearly marked** in release notes
- **Promptly communicated** via GitHub
- **Backported** to supported versions when possible
- **Documented** with appropriate CVE numbers
